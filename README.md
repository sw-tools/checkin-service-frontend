# Checkin Service Frontend

## Developing

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.

## TODO

- Add environment variables to Netlify configuration via Netlify's UI
